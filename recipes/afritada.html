    <ol>
        <li>Chicken– Bone-in chicken works best in this recipe as it brings a deeper flavor. If you prefer boneless, choose thigh fillets as the breast can turn dry and chewy in the slow cooking process.</li>
        <li>Roma Tomatoes– use ripe tomatoes as they’re sweeter and juicier</li>
        <li>Vegetables– potatoes, carrots, bell peppers, and sweet peas extend servings and add color and texture.</li>
        <li>Fish sauce– adds umami flavor</li>


    </ol>

<p>In a pan over medium heat, heat oil. 
    Add potatoes and carrots and cook, turning once or twice, until lightly browned. Remove from pan and drain on paper towels. 
    Remove excess oil from pan except for about 2 tablespoons.
    Add bell peppers and cook for about 30 to 45 seconds. Remove from pan and drain on paper towels.
